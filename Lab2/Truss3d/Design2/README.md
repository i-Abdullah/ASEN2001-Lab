# The following folder contains the truss designs we came up with. The folder contains some functions required to operate the main script. All you have to do is to **Run the main script TrussInNOutDesign1.m** which in return will call the other functions/files.

* Everything file is commented. The files/functions are:

`TrussInNOutDesign2.m:` The main script that controls everything. All you have to do is to run it and it will call all other functions. The first lines has the name of the input/output files, thus it can be used with other input files that has the same format to do the exact same thing. All you have to do to use it with another file is to change the name of the input file and maybe the output if you do not want the output to be over-written.

`ExtractTruss.m:` This function extracts information from a given txt file. The text file is commented by # symbols and the code will go and get everything in between.

`addweight.m:` This function will adjust given vectors of external loads and their locations and return two vectors, one about the location of the joints, and one about their actual magnitude in x y z.

`FAA:` Force analysis function. It runs the static equilibrium equations and outputs analysis results.

`writeoutput.m:` function made by Kurt Maute, provided to us by the TA's. The function will write the outputs of 

`MonteCarls.m:` Stochastic analysis of 3-D statically determinate truss by Monte Carlo Simulation. Only positions and strength of joints treated as random variables.

`plotturss.m:` plot 3D-truss, bars colored according to force supported nodes are plotted in red non-supported nodes are plotted in black.

`Design2.inp:` Matlab input file, generated by a GUI provided from the TA's. It is inputted to the TrussInNOutDesign1.m and analyzed. Can be opened as txt file.

`Design2out.txt:` Output text file that presents all the result of the static analysis.
