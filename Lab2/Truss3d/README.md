* **Group1_CDR** The first Design.

* **Group1_CDR** The CDR Presentation.

* **Group1_FinalReport** The final report.

* IMPORTANT: The files the GUI will output WILL NOT have external loads in them, and for the analysis to run an external loads must be there even if it was empty, so you must go manually and edit the file where the external load is. Something like 1 0 0 0 can be inputted which means joint 1 has 0 forces in the x,y,z.
