* This lab is concerned with the analysis and design of composite beams. Beams are frequently used componentsin aerospace structures, such as wings, booms, etc. To reduce their weight and to tailor their stiffness and strength toparticular loading conditions, beams are often made of several materials. Such beams are called composite beams. Incomparison with truss structures, the structural response of beams can be rather complex and various forms of failureneed to be carefully considered in the design process.
